# Naive Bayes Example on HR Data

This repository demonstrates how to use a Naive Bayes classifier (from the `e1071` R package) to predict employee performance scores (`PerfScore`) based on their mechanical aptitude (`MechanicalApt`). The example uses a real-world style HR dataset and walks through model training, prediction, and evaluation.

## Files

- `NaiveBayesHW.csv` — The sample HR dataset with columns including `PerfScore` and `MechanicalApt`.
- `naive_bayes_example.R` — The main R script implementing the Naive Bayes workflow.

## Usage

### 1. Install Required Package

Make sure you have the `e1071` package installed:

### 2. Run the Script

Open `naive_bayes_example.R` in your R environment or RStudio and run the script.  
The script will:

- Load the HR data from `NaiveBayesHW.csv`
- Train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict `PerfScore` using `MechanicalApt`
- Print the model summary and predictions
- Calculate and print the number and percentage of correct predictions
- Show the predictions and class probabilities for the 10th individual in the dataset

### 3. Output Example

The output will display:

- The trained Naive Bayes model details
- Predictions for all individuals
- The number and percent of correct predictions (model accuracy)
- Data and probability predictions for the 10th individual

## Example Output

Number of correctly predicted Performance Scores: 85 
Total Number of Performance Scores: 100 
Percent Correct: 85%
